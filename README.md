# Modeling-Financial-Inclusion-in-Developing-Countries

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between digital finance and financial inclusion in developing countries using data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and the World Bankâ€™s Global Findex. We conducted econometric estimations using both OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and instrumental variable methods to study the impact of various socio-economic factors on financial inclusion.

## Data Collection
1. **Developing Countries**: We referred to the list of 152 developing countries provided by the United Nations.
2. **Data Availability**: Due to missing data, we reduced the sample to less than 150 countries for 2018, and after further filtering, the final sample consists of 92 countries.
3. **Data Sources**: Data was gathered from multiple databases:
   - **World Development Indicators (WDI)**: Various socio-economic variables.
   - **Global Findex**: Data on financial inclusion.

## Variables Used
- **country_name**: Names of the countries selected for this study.
- **deposit_account**: Share of the population with a deposit account.
- **loans**: Share of the population with loans.
- **savings**: Share of the population with savings.
- **digital_fin**: Digital finance usage captured through internet or mobile usage for financial transactions.
- **acces_elec**: Share of the population with access to electricity.
- **employ_agri**: Share of agricultural employment.
- **self_employ**: Share of self-employment.
- **foreign_DI**: Foreign direct investment as a share of GDP.
- **gdp**: Gross domestic product (GDP) at constant 2015 prices.
- **CPI**: Consumer price index, used to capture inflation.
- **urban_pop**: Urban population.
- **rural_pop**: Rural population.
- **total_pop**: Total population.
- **pop_density**: Population density.
- **HCI (Human Capital Index)**: A measure between 0 and 1 capturing the level of education and access to healthcare.
- **FI_Index (Financial Inclusion Index)**: An index (0-1) constructed following the method of Oumarou and Celestin (2021).

## Data Preprocessing
- **Transformation of Variables**: We converted variables into appropriate formats (e.g., factors, numeric, date objects) to prepare them for analysis.
- **Handling Missing and Outlier Values**:
  - Missing values in some variables like `sesso` (gender) were replaced with "Unknown".
  - Outliers in variables like birth year (`data di nascita`) were handled.
- **Merging Data**: After preprocessing, we merged the datasets and encoded binary variables to create a clean dataset (`base_esti`) for our estimations.

## Model Estimation

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
We estimated four models using OLS to examine the different dimensions of financial inclusion:
1. **Model 1**: Deposit account as the dependent variable.
2. **Model 2**: Loans as the dependent variable.
3. **Model 3**: Savings as the dependent variable.
4. **Model 4**: Financial Inclusion Index as the dependent variable.

We ran diagnostics on normality and goodness-of-fit for each model, including residual analysis and the Breusch-Pagan test for heteroskedasticity.

### Instrumental Variables (IV) Estimation
We re-estimated the models using an instrumental variable approach (2SLS) with the following instruments:
- **log_urban_pop** (urban population in log form).
- **log_pop_density** (population density in log form).

### Variables in Logarithmic Form
Some variables were transformed into logarithmic form to interpret results in terms of elasticity. These include:
- **log_dep_account**: Log of deposit accounts.
- **log_loans**: Log of loans.
- **log_savings**: Log of savings.
- **log_digital_fin**: Log of digital finance usage.
- **log_gdp**: Log of GDP.
- **log_CPI**: Log of consumer price index.
- **log_urban_pop**: Log of urban population.
- **log_pop_density**: Log of population density.

## Conclusion
Our models provide insights into the key determinants of financial inclusion in developing countries, with digital finance playing a significant role. By improving access to digital financial services and infrastructure (e.g., electricity), governments can promote greater financial inclusion.
